# Portfolio built with React
I originally had my website built with HMTL & CSS... and then I hit a wall where I wanted to conditionally render my navigation based on the screen size... I tried everything I could think of  `window.width..` & `window.onload`.. nothing was working. 

So I figured it was time to build the site with react components that could handle the conditional rendering I was looking for. The end.
